    "\n",
    "### Central Idea\n",
    "Mental health needs are often neglected in India due to stigma and lack of awareness. This project introduces a confidential AI Counseling Agent that listens, provides empathetic support, suggests coping strategies, and, in extreme cases, recommends professional psychiatrists or counselors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relevance & Innovation\n",
    "- Addresses a critical, underserved issue in India\n",
    "- Provides a safe, stigma-free support system\n",
    "- Uses agent-based architecture for modularity and scalability\n",
    "- Empathetic automation powered by AI\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use of Agents\n",
    "Agents are central to the solution:\n",
    "- **Main Agent** orchestrates user interaction\n",
    "- **Listener Sub-Agent** collects and understands user concerns\n",
    "- **Coping Strategy Sub-Agent** suggests solutions and exercises\n",
    "- **Referral Sub-Agent** recommends professionals in extreme cases"
