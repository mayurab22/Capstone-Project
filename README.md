# Mental Health Counseling Agent (India) - Capstone Project

## Problem Statement
Mental health needs are often neglected in India due to stigma and lack of awareness. People hesitate to seek help, fearing judgment or ridicule from society.

## Solution
A confidential AI Counseling Agent that listens, provides empathetic support, suggests coping strategies, and, in extreme cases, recommends professional psychiatrists or counselors. This agent addresses the critical gap in mental health support in India.

## Architecture
- **Main Agent**: Orchestrates user interaction and coordinates sub-agents
- **Listener Sub-Agent**: Collects and understands user concerns with empathy
- **Coping Strategy Sub-Agent**: Suggests solutions and exercises using AI
- **Referral Sub-Agent**: Recommends professionals in extreme cases
